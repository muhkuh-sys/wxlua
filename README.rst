 wxLua for minGW64
===================

Overview
========

This repository is a clone of the wxLua Subversion repository on SourceForge: http://svn.code.sf.net/p/wxlua/svn
It contains patches for minGW64 and has a build script for Travis CI. The build produces a DLL for the LUA interpreter which has no other dependencies than the LUA DLL and system libraries.
